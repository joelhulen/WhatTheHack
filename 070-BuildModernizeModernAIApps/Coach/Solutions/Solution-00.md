# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites - The Landing Before the Launch

**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

Challenge-00 is all about helping the student set up the prerequisites for this hack and deploy the environment to Azure. This includes necessary installations, environment options, and other libraries needed.

> [!TIP]
> If the student does not see data in the `product` and `customer` containers in Azure Cosmos DB, they should try re-running the `postdeployment` azd hook. To do this, they can execute the following command in the terminal: `azd hooks run postdeploy`.
