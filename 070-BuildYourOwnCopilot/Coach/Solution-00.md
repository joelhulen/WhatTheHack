**[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-01.md)

## Notes & Guidance

Challenge-00 is all about helping the student deploy resources to Azure in preparation for the launch of the POC. The student will deploy services into the landing zone in preparation for the launch of the POC.

> [!TIP]
> If the student does not see data in the `product` and `customer` containers in Azure Cosmos DB, they should try re-running the `postdeployment` `azd` hook. To do this, they can execute the following command in the terminal: `azd hooks run postdeploy`.
